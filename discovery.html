                Professor Bairstone and Dr Day, along with Ernest the dog, were on an expedition in Siberia when they discovered the Monk Diamond.<br>

                It had been hidden in a remote mountain cave.<br>
                
                The Bond Brothers attempted to sabotage the expedition and reclaim the diamond but were unsuccessful.<br>

                The team returned to Moscow with the diamond and a special exhibition is being held at the House of Volkov to celebrate their discovery.
