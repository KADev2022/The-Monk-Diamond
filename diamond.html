            The Monk Diamond is famous for its distinctive green colour.<br>

            A Russian nobleman bought the diamond for his wife in 1889, but it was stolen during the Russian Revolution. For the next 30 years, the Monk Diamond's whereabouts were unknown.<br>

            In 1947 it was discovered during a police raid on a gang of petty criminals in Moscow.<br>

            It was returned to the nobleman's family. The nobleman's son decided the Monk Diamond was unlucky and sold it to the House of Volkov, Moscow's oldest jewellery house.<br>

            The House of Volkov paid an undisclosed sum for the jewel, but it was rumoured to be the most expensive diamond sale ever.
